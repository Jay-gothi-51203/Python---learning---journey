# 1.)  What is PIP?
# PIP stands for "Pip Installs Packages". PIP is like Python app store.
# It’s a tool used in Python to install and manage external libraries or modules that are not included in the standard Python installation.
# You use it to download and install extra tools (called modules or libraries) that help you do more things with Python.


# 2.) What is a Module?
# A module is simply a Python file (.py) that contains code — like functions, classes, or variables — that you can reuse in other programs.
# A module is like a toolbox.
# It has ready-made code that someone else wrote, so you don’t have to start from scratch.

# Two Types of Modules:

# 1.) Built-in Modules (come with Python):
# math → for math functions
# random → for generating random numbers
# datetime → for working with dates and times

# 2.) External Modules (installed using pip):
# requests → for web requests
# pandas → for data analysis
# flask → for building websites


import pandas
print("hi")
