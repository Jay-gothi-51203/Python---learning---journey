# Topic : If else conditional staements.

# What is an if-else statement?
# It's a way to make decisions in your code.

# You tell Python:
# "If something is true, do this."
# "Else (if it's not true), do something else."

# if condition:
#     # code to run if condition is true
# else:
#     # code to run if condition is false

# Example: 
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are not an adult.")

# Whatâ€™s happening?
# Python checks if age >= 18
# If true, it prints "You are an adult."
# If false, it prints "You are a minor."


# âž• elif: You can also add elif (else if):
# Syntax: 
# if condition:
    # code to run if condition is True
# elif another_condition:
      # code to run if the above condition is False and this one is True
# else:
      # code to run if all the above conditions are False


num = int(input("Enter the number: "))

if num > 0:
    print(f"{num} is positive.")

elif num < 0:
    print(f"{num} is negative.")

else:
    print(f"{num} is zero.")

# 1.)Even or Odd Checker:Write a program that takes an integer input and prints whether it's even or odd.
num = int(input("Enter the number: "))

if num % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even.")
else:
    print("the number is odd.22")


# 2.) Grade Calculator
# Input a student's marks (0â€“100) and print their grade:
# 90+ â†’ A
# 80â€“89 â†’ B
# 70â€“79 â†’ C
# 60â€“69 â†’ D
# <60 â†’ F

percentage = int(input("Enter your percentage(%): "))


if percentage >= 90 and percentage <=100:
    print("congratulation!, you got 'A garde'.")

elif percentage >=80 :
    print("You got 'B garde'.")

elif percentage >=70:

elif percentage <60:

else:

# Age Group Classifier: Ask the user to enter their age and print which group they belong to:
# 0â€“12 â†’ Child
# 13â€“19 â†’ Teen
# 20â€“64 â†’ Adult
# 65+ â†’ Senior

# First is greater
# Second is greater
# Both are equal

# 4.) Leap Year Checker: Ask the user to input a year and print whether it's a leap year or not.
# (Hint: A year is leap if divisible by 4 and not 100, or divisible by 400)

# 6.) Simple Login System: Ask the user to input a username and password.
# If both are correct, print "Login successful"
# If either is wrong, print "Invalid credentials"
