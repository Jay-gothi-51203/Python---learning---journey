# ðŸ”· What is match-case in Python?
# The match-case statement is like a switch statement in other languages. It helps you compare one value against several patterns and execute code based on which pattern matches.

# It is like saying:
# "If the value is this, do that. If it's something else, do another thing."


#  Imagine a real-life example:

# You go to a vending machine, and you press a button for a drink.
# If you press 1, you get Coke.
# If you press 2, you get Pepsi.
# If you press 3, you get Water.
# If you press anything else, the machine says "Invalid choice".

# Syntax: 

#  match variable_name:
    # case value1:
         # Code to run if variable_name == value1
    # case value2:
         # Code to run if variable_name == value2
    # case value3:
         # Code to run if variable_name == value3
    # case _: (Default case, only one)
         # Code to run if none of the above match (default)

# Example:

print(''' We have three options for you:
    Option - 1: Press 1 to get a coke.
    Option - 2: Press 2 to get a pepsi.
    Option - 3: Press 3 to get a maza.
''')
choice = int(input("Enter the number: "))

match choice:
    case 1:
        print("You chose Coke")
    case 2:
        print("You chose Pepsi")
    case 3:
        print("You chose Water")
    case _:
        print("Invalid choice")
