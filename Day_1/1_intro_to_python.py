# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It’s used in a wide range of applications, from web development to data science, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.
# Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. 

# Python was invented by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, and its first official release was in 1991

# 👨‍💻 About Guido van Rossum: 
# - 🇳🇱 Dutch computer programmer
# - He created Python while working at a research institute in the Netherlands called CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica).
# - He wanted a language that was easy to read and write — a cleaner alternative to languages like C and Perl.
# - Fun fact: He named Python not after the snake 🐍, but after the British comedy group Monty Python!

#  📆 Timeline
# - 1989 (December)**: Guido starts working on Python as a holiday project.
# - 1991 (February 20)**: Python 0.9.0 is released.
# - It included core features like functions, exceptions, and modules.
# - Over the years, Python grew rapidly with the help of a passionate open-source community.

#   Key Features of Python:
# - Easy to learn & use – Clean syntax that resembles English.
# - Interpreted language – No need to compile code before running it.
# - Dynamically typed – You don’t need to declare variable types.
# - Huge standard library – Includes modules for everything from file handling to math and web services.
# - Supports multiple programming paradigms – Object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.

#   Common Uses:
# - Web Development (e.g., with Django, Flask)
# - Data Analysis & Visualization  (e.g., with Pandas, Matplotlib)
# - Machine Learning & AI  (e.g., with TensorFlow, PyTorch)
# - Scripting & Automation (e.g., automating file systems or web scraping)
# - Game Development (e.g., with Pygame)
# - Internet of Things (IoT) 

# Example: 
print("Hello world!")
print(5)
