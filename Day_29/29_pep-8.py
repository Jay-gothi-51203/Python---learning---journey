# PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal, and there are several of them. A PEP is a document that describes new features proposed for Python and documents aspects of Python, like design and style, for the community.

# PEP 8 is the style guide for writing Python code. It tells you how to format your Python code so that it's clean, readable, and consistent.

# Think of PEP 8 as the rules of writing nicely in Python â€” like good handwriting for your code!
